# Time Picker Experiment

This is an attempt to clone the watchOS Alarm app's time picker, using SwiftUI.

So far it's pretty functional, with a few differences in behaviour.

# Code

It's all in one file, [here](https://github.com/cmsj/SwiftUITimePicker/blob/main/HLYTimePickerExperiment%20WatchKit%20Extension/ContentView.swift)
